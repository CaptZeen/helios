Helios 1.4.2018.0924 Beta is not an explicit collaboration with Craig Courtney, 
but it relies heavily on the original Helios.  This distribution is not endorsed 
by Craig Courtney.  
                                                                     
This code is beta code, as is the installer.

If you encounter problems, please check for known issues here 
https://github.com/BlueFinBima/helios/issues and if nothing appears to be 
relevant then open a new issue.
  
* * * Before Installation * * *

1) Make a complete back-up of your %userprofile%\Helios directory.  I take no 
responsibility for messing up your current Helios profiles 

2) Ensure that you back up all of your existing Exports.lua scripts and the 
like.  I am not expecting that the A-10C interface will change the Exports.LUA 
from the original Helios 1.3 version, assuming that if you install from this 
level, however it might do.  If you install the scripting from the new AV-8B or 
MiG-21Bis intereface, it will *definitely* replace the current export.lua 
      
3) Uninstall Helios 1.3 (you can always get it back from 
http://www.gadrocsworkshop.com/helios/latest ) 

4) You can choose not to Uninstall Helios 1.3 and install this code to a 
different directory and this should work ok.  * However * there are no claims of 
the backward compatibility of profiles so if you edit a profile with this 
release of Helios, then it is likely to cause problems if you attempt to open it 
again in an older version of Helios so point 1 above is very important.  

5) Make sure you virus scan the installation.  I believe my build system to be 
virus free, however I make no claims that it is virus free, and I take no 
responsibility for any damage to your system as a result of installation of 
Helios or its install mechanism.  

6) The exectuables are not currently signed so a warning for this will be issued 
during installation and running of the software.  It is completely your decision 
and risk if you ignore warnings.  

* * * After Installation * * *

1) If you add the AV-8B or MiG-21Bis Interface into a profile, you will need to 
deploy the Exports.lua for the AV-8B or MiG-21Bis interface for it to 
communicate between DCS and the Helios Control Center.  If you leave the Helios 
A-10C Exports.lua in place, then the result will not be pleasant.
